---

## üß± System Architecture

This section outlines the high-level architecture of the KidSkills educational application.

### Frontend (Client)
- Built with: React
- Layout Structure:
  - **Sidebar Layout:** Implement a responsive sidebar for player selection and settings.
  - **Main Content Area:** Dedicated area for displaying questions and handling gameplay.
  - **Components:** Modular components for different functionalities (sidebar, player selection, game area, etc.).
- Responsibilities:
  - Allow user to select player (e.g., Kid 1 / Kid 2) and update settings (Grade 2/3, Math/English, Easy/Medium/Hard).
  - Fetch challenges from backend.
  - Display questions and accept answers.
  - Show feedback (incorporating UI/UX enhancements below).
  - Display session score.
- UI/UX Enhancements:
  - **Theme:** Powder blue color palette with complementary pastel colors, creating a calm, friendly environment suitable for all children. The theme includes light blues, mint greens, and soft peach accents.
  - **Sidebar Design:** 
    - Fixed width (250-300px) with proper padding (15-20px)
    - Contained dropdowns that fit within sidebar width
    - Use Bootstrap icons for visual hierarchy
    - Compact player selection cards
    - Responsive behavior (push content in landscape, overlay in portrait)
  - **Answer Selection:** 
    - Clickable answer cards that visually highlight when selected
    - Submit button to confirm selection
    - Color-coded feedback: green for correct answers, red for incorrect answers
  - **Feedback:** Use emojis alongside text (e.g., "Correct! Great job! üéâ", "Incorrect. Keep trying! ü§î").
  - **Correct Answer Celebration:** Trigger a full-screen confetti effect using the `react-confetti` library with pink and blue colors. Confetti displays for 5 seconds upon correct answers.
  - **Incorrect Answer Feedback:** Highlight the correct answer in green, while the incorrect selection remains red. Show text indicating the correct answer.
  - **Question Progression:** Automatic advancement to the next question after 6 seconds, with a countdown timer showing the remaining time.
  - **Session Score:** Display a simple running score for the current session (e.g., "Score: 5 / 8") prominently on the page with animated achievement badges for streaks.
  - **Layout:** Clean, organized interface with a header subtitle and branded footer, consistent spacing, and responsive design for different screen sizes.

### Backend (Server)
- Built with: FastAPI
- Responsibilities:
  - Manage *simple* player settings (perhaps keyed by name in DB or passed from client).
  - Generate AI prompts based on selected settings (Grade, Subject, Difficulty) and send to OpenRouter.
  - Record basic progress (questions, answers).
  - Provide APIs for frontend:
    - `/challenge/get`: fetch new question based on settings.
    - `/challenge/submit`: submit answer and get feedback.

### Database
- SQLite3 (with SQLAlchemy ORM)
- Tables:
  - `players`: Store basic player info (name, grade) and selected settings.
  - `progress`: Log user answers, questions, timestamps for basic tracking.
- Advantages:
  - File-based (no separate database server needed)
  - Zero configuration required
  - Python standard library support
  - Perfect for small applications and home use

### SQLite Schema
```python
# SQLAlchemy models

from sqlalchemy import Boolean, Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String, DateTime, Text
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.sql import func
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

Base = declarative_base()

class Player(Base):
    __tablename__ = "players"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String, unique=True, index=True)
    grade = Column(Integer)  # 2 or 3
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=func.now())
    
    # Default settings
    preferred_subject = Column(String, default="Math")  # "Math" or "English"
    preferred_sub_activity = Column(String, default="Addition/Subtraction")  # Changes based on subject
    preferred_difficulty = Column(String, default="Easy")  # "Easy", "Medium", "Hard"
    
    # Relationship
    progress = relationship("Progress", back_populates="player")


class Progress(Base):
    __tablename__ = "progress"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    player_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("players.id"))
    
    # Question details
    question_text = Column(Text)
    question_type = Column(String)  # "multiple-choice", "direct-answer", "reading-comprehension"
    subject = Column(String)  # "Math" or "English"
    sub_activity = Column(String)  # e.g., "Addition/Subtraction", "Opposites/Antonyms"
    difficulty = Column(String)  # "Easy", "Medium", "Hard"
    
    # Answer details
    user_answer = Column(Text)
    correct_answer = Column(Text)
    is_correct = Column(Boolean)
    
    # Metadata
    timestamp = Column(DateTime, default=func.now())
    
    # Relationship
    player = relationship("Player", back_populates="progress")
```

### Backend Components

- **FastAPI Application**: Main backend framework that handles API requests and orchestrates the game logic
- **Database Module**: Manages player data, progress, and game state
- **Langflow Service Integration**: Interfaces with configured Langflow workflows via HTTP API calls for dynamic question generation and advanced feedback. Manages interaction with the Langflow instance (running separately).
- **Fallback Question Service**: Provides pre-defined questions and basic feedback when Langflow is unavailable or fails.
- **Question Generator**: Constructs prompts based on game settings (subject, grade, difficulty) and sends them to specific Langflow workflows via the Langflow Service Integration.
- **Answer Validator**: Compares player answers to correct answers and determines correctness. For activities like Grammar Correction and Reading Comprehension, it leverages Langflow workflows via the Feedback Generator for evaluation.
- **Feedback Generator**: Primarily relies on calling specific Langflow evaluation workflows (e.g., `grammar-evaluation`, `reading-comprehension-evaluation`) via the Langflow Service Integration to produce detailed, AI-powered feedback. Uses fallback logic otherwise.

### AI Integration

The application uses the following AI components, primarily orchestrated via Langflow:

1. **Question Generation**:
   - **Langflow Workflows**: Dedicated Langflow workflows (e.g., `math-multiple-choice`, `grammar-correction`, `reading-comprehension`, etc., configured via environment variables like `LANGFLOW_WORKFLOW_MATH_MULTIPLE_CHOICE`) are called via HTTP API requests (`/api/v1/run/{workflow_name}`) from the FastAPI backend's `ai_service.py`.
   - **Dynamic Prompting**: The backend constructs prompts based on player settings (Grade, Subject, Sub-Activity, Difficulty) and sends them as input to the appropriate Langflow workflow.
   - **Langflow Handles Models**: Langflow workflows internally handle interactions with the chosen AI models. The backend is abstracted from the specific model details.
   - **Fallback**: If a Langflow workflow call fails or is not configured (checked via environment variables), the system falls back to pre-defined questions managed by the Fallback Question Service.

2. **Advanced Feedback Mechanism**:
   - **Langflow Evaluation Workflows**: Specific Langflow workflows (e.g., `grammar-evaluation`, `reading-comprehension-evaluation`, configured via environment variables like `LANGFLOW_WORKFLOW_GRAMMAR_EVALUATION`) handle detailed feedback generation and answer evaluation.
   - **Contextual Input**: The backend (`ai_service.py`) sends the original question, user's answer, correct answer, and correctness status to the appropriate Langflow evaluation workflow.
   - **Tailored Feedback**: Langflow workflows generate AI-powered feedback customized for correctness and the specific activity (e.g., explaining grammar rules), returning structured JSON.
   - **API Integration**: The evaluation logic is primarily triggered within the `POST /api/challenges/submit` endpoint, which calls the relevant Langflow evaluation workflows via `ai_service.py` (e.g., `evaluate_grammar_correction_langflow`, `evaluate_reading_comprehension_langflow`). The separate `POST /api/grammar/feedback` endpoint also exists but might be less central.
   - **Fallback**: Simple, predefined feedback is used if the Langflow call fails.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust error handling for Langflow API interactions (timeouts, HTTP errors, response parsing) within `ai_service.py`.
   - Fallback to pre-defined responses ensures game continuity.
   - Detailed logging for debugging interactions with Langflow.

### Frontend Components

### üîê Player Selection (Simplified)
- No formal login/signup.
- Player Selection: Simple dropdown/buttons on the frontend to choose between pre-defined players (e.g., "Kid 1 - Grade 3", "Kid 2 - Grade 2"). Settings are loaded/saved based on the selected player name.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Settings

Settings a user can configure (on the main page):
- Player: Kid 1 (Grade 3) / Kid 2 (Grade 2)
- Subject: Math / English / Gujarati
- Sub-Activity: 
  - For Math: Addition/Subtraction, Multiplication/Division, Word Problems
  - For English: Opposites/Antonyms, Reading Comprehension, Nouns/Pronouns, Grammar Correction
  - For Gujarati: Letter Tracing
- Difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard (Note: Difficulty may not apply initially to tracing)

Note: All activities are continuous by design, with questions automatically advancing after each answer.

---

## üìö Challenge Types & Subjects (Focus for MVP)

### Math (Grade 2 & 3 Focus)
Sub-activities available:
1. **Addition/Subtraction** (Multiple Choice)
   - Basic operations with numbers appropriate for grade level
   - Visual representation questions (e.g., "How many apples are left?")

2. **Multiplication/Division** (Multiple Choice)
   - Basic operations with numbers appropriate for grade level
   - Visual representation questions with groups

3. **Word Problems** (Reading Comprehension + Multiple Choice)
   - Simple real-world scenarios requiring mathematical operations
   - Problems involving money, time, or measurement appropriate to grade level

### English (Grade 2 & 3 Focus)
Sub-activities available:
1. **Opposites/Antonyms** (Multiple Choice)
   - Word pairs with opposite meanings
   - Grade-appropriate vocabulary challenges

2. **Reading Comprehension** (Reading Passage + Multiple Choice Questions)
   - Short passages appropriate for grade level
   - Questions about the main idea, details, and inferences

3. **Nouns/Pronouns** (Fill-in-the-blank Multiple Choice)
   - Sentences with missing words to be filled with the correct noun or pronoun
   - Identifying parts of speech in sentences

4. **Grammar Correction** (Direct Answer)
   - Grammatically incorrect sentences that the player must correct
   - Player types in the corrected sentence
   - Answer validation uses case-insensitive comparison with some flexibility for extra spaces
   - Examples:
     - "She don't like ice cream." should be corrected to "She doesn't like ice cream."
     - "The cats is playing." should be corrected to "The cats are playing."

### Gujarati (Pre-K / Kindergarten Focus)
Sub-activities available:
1. **Letter Tracing** (Canvas Input)
   - **Goal:** Help young children learn to write Gujarati letters.
   - **Format:** Displays a Gujarati letter image in one box. Provides a second empty box (HTML Canvas) for the child to trace the letter using a mouse or touchscreen.
   - **UI:** Two side-by-side boxes. Left box shows the target letter image. Right box is a drawing canvas. Buttons: "Submit", "Clear".
   - **Validation:**
     - On submit, the frontend captures the drawing from the canvas as an image (e.g., PNG data URL).
     - This image data is sent to the backend.
     - Backend compares the submitted tracing image with the original letter image using pixel-based comparison (e.g., calculating Structural Similarity Index - SSIM, or simple pixel difference percentage).
     - A similarity score (e.g., 0-100%) is returned.
     - Frontend displays feedback based on the score (e.g., "Good try!", "Excellent tracing!", "Keep practicing!").
   - **Image Assets:** Requires a set of images for each Gujarati letter (e.g., `ka.png`, `kha.png`, etc.) stored on the backend or accessible via URL.
   - **No AI Needed:** This activity relies on direct image comparison, not AI generation.

---

## üß† AI Question Generation

- Powered by Langflow, using specific workflows called via HTTP API from the backend service (`ai_service.py`).
- Prompts constructed dynamically based on:
  - Selected Player's Grade (2 or 3)
  - Subject (Math/English)
  - Sub-Activity (e.g., Addition/Subtraction, Opposites/Antonyms, etc.)
  - Difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Returned format is expected to be JSON, parsed by the backend (`ai_service.py`). The exact structure depends on the specific Langflow workflow being called. Fallbacks are used if parsing fails or the structure is invalid.

---

## üé≤ RANDOMNESS MANAGEMENT IN AI-GENERATED QUESTIONS (Simplified for MVP)

Focus on basic prompt randomization and inherent AI variety managed within Langflow workflows.

### Prompt Engineering: Controlled Randomness

Prompts are dynamically constructed with:
- **Fixed Parameters** (from user selection):
  - Subject (Math / English)
  - Sub-Activity (e.g., Addition/Subtraction, Reading Comprehension)
  - Grade level (2 or 3)
  - Difficulty
- **Randomized Elements** (implicitly via AI or basic prompt structure):
  - Numbers (math)
  - Word choices / names (English)

**Sample Prompt (Math - Addition/Subtraction - Grade 2 Easy)**:
```
Generate an easy 2nd-grade level math question about addition/subtraction involving two-digit addition where no carrying is required. Provide the question text and 4 multiple choice options with the correct answer.
```

**Sample Prompt (English - Opposites/Antonyms - Grade 3 Medium)**:
```
Generate a medium difficulty 3rd-grade level English question about opposites/antonyms. Provide a word and ask for its opposite with 4 multiple choice options.
```

---

### AI Creativity Parameters

Use OpenRouter's AI temperature and top-p controls (Keep default or slightly lower temperature for consistency):
| Parameter      | Purpose                          | Recommended Value |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| `temperature`  | Controls creativity randomness   | 0.4 ‚Äì 0.6         |
| `top_p`        | Narrows focus on token pool      | 0.8 ‚Äì 0.9         |

These help keep questions reasonably diverse yet appropriate.

## üìã Question Types and Handling

The game will support three main question types, each with specific UI components and answer validation approaches:

### 1. Multiple Choice Questions
- **Format**: Question with 3-4 possible answers to choose from
- **UI Implementation**: 
  - Clickable answer cards that highlight when selected
  - Submit button to confirm selection and check answer
  - Visual feedback: Correct answers turn green, incorrect answers turn red with the correct answer highlighted in green
- **Example**: 
  - Math: "What is 7 + 8?" with options [13, 14, 15, 16]
  - English: "Which word means 'happy'?" with options [sad, glad, mad, bad]
- **Answer Validation**: Direct comparison of selected option with correct answer
- **Feedback Flow**:
  1. Player selects an answer choice
  2. Player clicks the Submit button
  3. If correct: 
     - Selected answer turns green
     - Pink and blue confetti rains down for 5 seconds
     - Game automatically advances to next question after 6 seconds
  4. If incorrect:
     - Selected answer gets red border
     - Correct answer gets green border
     - Text displays showing the correct answer
     - Game automatically advances to next question after 6 seconds
- **AI Prompt Example**: 
  ```
  Generate a 3rd-grade multiple choice math question with exactly 4 options.
  Return as JSON with "question", "choices" (array of 4 options), and "answer" (the correct option).
  ```

### 2. Direct Answer Questions
- **Format**: Question requiring a text/number input from the student
- **UI Implementation**: Text input field with submit button
- **Example**: 
  - Math: "What is 25 + 17?"
  - English: "Spell the word: [audio would say 'together']"
- **Answer Validation**: 
  - For math: Numerical comparison
  - For spelling/text: Case-insensitive string comparison, possibly with tolerance for minor typos
- **AI Prompt Example**:
  ```
  Generate a 2nd-grade spelling question. Return as JSON with "question" (use "Spell the word: [word]"), 
  and "answer" (the correct spelling).
  ```

### 3. Reading Comprehension / Word Problems
- **Format**: Short passage or story followed by a question about the content
- **UI Implementation**: Text passage displayed above question, which could be multiple choice or direct answer
- **Example**:
  - English: "Sarah has 3 red apples and 2 green apples. How many apples does she have in total?"
  - English: A short story followed by "What did the main character learn?"
- **Answer Validation**: Depends on sub-type (multiple choice or direct answer)
- **AI Prompt Example**:
  ```
  Generate a short 2nd-grade reading passage (2-3 sentences) followed by a question about it.
  Return as JSON with "passage", "question", and "answer".
  ```

### 4. Grammar Correction
- **Format**: Grammatically incorrect sentence that needs to be corrected by the player
- **UI Implementation**: 
  - Text area input for typing the corrected sentence
  - Submit button to check answer
  - Visual feedback: Highlights differences between user's answer and correct answer
- **Example**: 
  - "He walk to school everyday." should be corrected to "He walks to school everyday."
  - "They was playing in the park." should be corrected to "They were playing in the park."
- **Answer Validation**: 
  - Case-insensitive string comparison
  - Optional normalization to account for extra spaces or alternative punctuation
  - Highlight differences between submitted answer and correct answer when incorrect
- **Feedback Flow**:
  1. Player types in their corrected sentence
  2. Player clicks the Submit button
  3. If correct: 
     - Text area gets green border
     - Pink and blue confetti rains down for 5 seconds
     - AI-powered detailed feedback explains what grammar rule they applied correctly
     - Game automatically advances to next question after 6 seconds
  4. If incorrect:
     - Text area gets red border
     - Correct sentence is displayed below
     - AI-powered detailed feedback explains what grammar mistake they missed
     - Game automatically advances to next question after 6 seconds
- **AI Feedback Enhancement**:
  - After submission, the system sends both the original question and the student's answer to the AI
  - For correct answers: AI explains what grammatical error was identified and how it was properly fixed
  - For incorrect answers: AI provides a gentle explanation of what was missed and offers a helpful tip
  - Feedback is tailored for elementary school level understanding
  - Fallback feedback is provided if the AI service is unavailable

#### Enhanced Randomization for Grammar Correction
To ensure variety in grammar correction questions, the system should incorporate:

1. **Diverse Error Types**:
   - Subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., "The dog bark loudly")
   - Verb tense errors (e.g., "Yesterday, she walk to school")
   - Pronoun errors (e.g., "Me went to the store")
   - Article usage (e.g., "She has a apple")
   - Pluralization errors (e.g., "Three cat are playing")
   - Double negatives (e.g., "She don't have no pencils")
   - Adjective order (e.g., "The blue big ball")
   - Preposition usage (e.g., "She arrived to home")

2. **Varied Sentence Patterns**:
   - Simple sentences with subject-verb-object
   - Compound sentences with conjunctions
   - Sentences with prepositional phrases
   - Questions with errors
   - Sentences with different tenses (past, present, future)
   - Sentences with modifiers and adverbs

3. **Diverse Topics and Contexts**:
   - School-related sentences
   - Family-related sentences
   - Nature/animal-related sentences
   - Sports and hobbies
   - Everyday activities
   - Seasonal events and holidays

4. **Prompt Randomization Parameters**:
   ```python
   def generate_grammar_correction_prompt(grade, difficulty):
       # Randomly select error type
       error_types = [
           "subject-verb agreement", 
           "verb tense", 
           "pronoun usage", 
           "article usage",
           "plural forms", 
           "prepositions"
       ]
       
       # Select complexity appropriate for grade level
       if grade <= 2:  # Grades 1-2
           # Simpler error types for younger students
           error_type = random.choice(error_types[:3])  
           
           # Select topics relevant to younger students
           topics = ["school activities", "family", "pets", "playground games"]
           topic = random.choice(topics)
           
           # Simpler sentence structures
           sentence_type = "simple sentence"
       else:  # Grade 3+
           # Full range of error types for older students
           error_type = random.choice(error_types) 
           
           # More diverse topics
           topics = ["school subjects", "hobbies", "nature", "sports", "community", "daily routines"]
           topic = random.choice(topics)
           
           # More varied sentence structures
           sentence_types = ["simple sentence", "compound sentence", "question", "sentence with prepositional phrase"]
           sentence_type = random.choice(sentence_types)
       
       # Build the prompt with specific randomization instructions
       prompt = f"""
       Create a {difficulty.lower()} {grade}-grade level English grammar correction question.
       
       Write a {sentence_type} about {topic} with exactly ONE grammatical error involving {error_type}.
       The error should be appropriate for a {grade}-grade student to identify and fix.
       
       The question should be the incorrect sentence, and the answer should be the fully corrected sentence.
       Make sure the sentence sounds natural and uses age-appropriate vocabulary.
       Do not use the same pattern as these examples: "She don't like ice cream", "The cats is playing", "He walk to school".
       """
       
       return prompt
   ```

5. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Update the `construct_prompt` function to use the enhanced randomization approach
   - Set a higher temperature value (0.7-0.8) specifically for grammar correction to increase variety
   - Include specific instructions to avoid repeating patterns from previous questions
   - Add logging to track and analyze the types of questions being generated

These enhancements will significantly increase question variety while maintaining grade-level appropriateness.

### Frontend Implementation
For each question type, the frontend will:
1. Detect the question type from the `type` field in the API response
2. Render the appropriate UI component (choice selector, text input, or reading passage + question)
3. Apply the correct validation logic when checking answers
4. Show appropriate feedback and trigger confetti on correct answers

### Backend Implementation
The backend will:
1. Include the question type in the prompt to the AI
2. Parse and validate the AI's response to ensure it matches the expected format
3. Send the structured question data to the frontend
4. Receive and validate answers according to the question type

This approach allows for variety in question formats while maintaining a consistent gameplay experience.

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### CORS Configuration
To enable communication between the React frontend (port 3000) and FastAPI backend (port 8000), CORS needs to be configured:

For home network access, you may need to add the IP-based URL to `allow_origins` as well:
```python
allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://192.168.1.X:3000"]
```

        -   [x] Trigger confetti or other celebration based on score threshold.
        -   [x] Handle automatic progression to the next letter after feedback/timeout.
3.  **Integration:**
    -   [x] Update `App.js` or main game component to conditionally render `GujaratiTracingActivity` based on selected settings (Subject: Gujarati, Sub-Activity: Letter Tracing).
    -   [x] Update Sidebar component (`Sidebar.js`):
        -   [x] Add "Gujarati" to the Subject dropdown.
        -   [x] Update `useEffect` logic to show "Letter Tracing" sub-activity when Gujarati is selected. (Handled via SUB_ACTIVITIES constant)
        -   [x] Ensure state management handles the new subject/activity. (Handled via SUB_ACTIVITIES constant)
4.  **API Service Updates:**

1. **Student to Frontend**:
   - Student receives incorrect grammar sentence
   - Student submits corrected version
   - Frontend determines initial correctness

2. **Frontend to Backend**:
   - Frontend sends:
     - Original question (incorrect sentence)
     - Student's answer (their correction)
     - Correct answer (from initial submission response)
     - Whether answer was correct (boolean)

3. **Backend to AI**:
   - Backend calls OpenRouter with appropriate prompt
   - Prompt includes context and instructions tailored based on correctness

4. **AI to Backend**:
   - AI generates personalized feedback
   - Explains grammar rule (if correct) or mistake (if incorrect)
   - Uses child-friendly language

5. **Backend to Frontend**:
   - Returns structured feedback response
   - Includes fallback feedback if AI failed

6. **Frontend to Student**:
   - Displays feedback in UI
   - Shows loading state while feedback is being generated
   - Presents feedback in appropriate styling based on correctness

This approach provides value beyond simple right/wrong feedback by explaining the underlying grammar concepts to the student, making it more educational.
